# @norathefurry/reactcomponents

Some random react components

# Usage

Import using `import ReactComponents from '@norathefurry/reactcomponents';`

(in js, use `const ReactComponents = require('@norathefurry/reactcomponents');`/`const { COMPONENT } = require('@norathefurry/reactcomponents');`, replace `COMPONENT` with the name(s) of the components you want/need)

# Components

## UwUify

turns the contents (must be a string, using react components as the content doesn't work nicely) into uwuified versions

additional information:

> use `UwUify.uwuify` (UwUify being a refrence to the non-constructed class) to UwUify text manually, and `UwUify.uwuifyWithFaces` to manually UwUify with faces

## YearsSince

YearsSince shows the time since `YearsSince.time` with `YearsSince.precision` (optional, defaults to `1`) as the precision.

# Extra Notes

i'll randomly add things periodically
